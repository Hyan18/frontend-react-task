### Thoughts

I really enjoyed it although I would have liked to have done more, a lot of things ended up taking up more time than I had expected. Before this task, I was familiar with using REST APIs and some React but that was about it, so had to learn about everything else - i.e react routing and look into a lot more css.
If I had more time, the next thing I would be doing is the errors for the form in which I would read the response data for the Errors array and have a error component show up displaying the associated errors.
